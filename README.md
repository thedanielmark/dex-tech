**Electra** is a revolutionary blockchain-based M2M (Machine-to-Machine) payments platform designed to simplify the electric vehicle (EV) charging experience. Unlike traditional methods, Electra offers a seamless and user-friendly solution that allows individuals to join the network through their EV charging station or electric vehicle. Here's how it works:

1. **User-Friendly Onboarding:** Electra offers a hassle-free onboarding process. EV owners can easily sign up for the network using their EV charging station or electric vehicle, eliminating the need for complex registration procedures.
2. **Effortless Charging:** Once onboarded, users can effortlessly locate nearby charging stations through the Electra platform. This ensures that EV owners can find convenient charging points whenever they need them.
3. **Automated M2M Payments:** Electra streamlines the payment process. Users no longer need to deal with cumbersome payment methods. Instead, the platform automates M2M payments every time a charging session is completed. This ensures that users are billed accurately and promptly for the electricity they consume.
4. **Income Generation:** Electra empowers EV charging station owners to monetize their assets. Users have the option to lease their EV charging stations to the general public, earning ElectraCoins as a form of compensation. This innovative approach transforms charging stations into income-generating assets for their owners.
5. **Decentralized Governance:** Electra's governance is decentralized and community-driven. The network is managed through a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), ensuring that important decisions are made collectively and transparently by token holders. This democratic approach ensures fairness and inclusivity in network operations.
6. **Tokenized Registry:** Electra takes advantage of blockchain technology to tokenize the registry of chargers. Each charger is represented as a unique token on the blockchain, making it easy to manage and trade assets within the network securely.
